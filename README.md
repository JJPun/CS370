Wrote code to address each issue in the episodes, loops and some other features. The project came with Keras and the relevant libraries in addition to model structure used in the neural network.
It also contained the controllers for the default variables.
Computer scientists work to come up with solutions to problems in efficient and intuitive ways in the use of computers.
Learning about AI throughout the course was interesting and informative. 
Automation is something to further research and understand in the future.
As a computer scientist, I would approach problems by asking myself how I could improve upon the idea or concept, is it intuitive, and is there a way to do it better?
This makes sure that I am doing my best to make a final product that is intuitive, easy to use, and covers all the needs of the user.
The ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization include the protection of user's personal information, their personal interests, and ensure the proper handling of user data.
